			<B>Oxford Languages Dictionary,</B>has defined technology as the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in Industry. In my understanding, technology is tools invented by human to advance in every field. Simply, everything we are using is technology. Internet is very vast network formed globally that contacts million of people through computers. In today’s world Internet is the most widely used technology. Therefore, internet is also called network of networks. </br></br>In this blog, we are going to be familiar us with the Internet Technology. Let’s us familiarize with some of terms first that are used for Internet Technology. Some of terms are:</br>World Wide Web (WWW): Millions of documents which are linked by HYPER TEXT links is present in WWW. </br>Webpage: It the document which is connected to WWW which is written by writing programming language called Hyper Text Markup language (HTML). </br>Home Pages: it is the first page of website. It is first page which is opened first after opening any website.</br>URL (Uniform Resource Locator): It is the address of a website ofc webpage on the Internet which is unique address.<br>Internet is being widely used to its different advantages such as easy to access, easy to use, due to low costing, interaction with other media such as News, publishing houses, due to vast communication network and communication facilities by texting, through voice or video and last but not the least, it helps to extended security system <a href="https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/internet-changed-everyday-life/#:~:text=The%20Internet%20has%20changed%20business,communication%20are%20of%20particular%20significance.[Accessed 20 May 2021" style="color: purple;">(Dentzel, 2021)</a> <!--css to give style for only these word-->. If we review our past, we have come a very long way with technology. From the stone age where people had just discovered how to fire to this modern age where many technologies have been introduced. Many different technologies as well depends on internet for its growth as well as.  Similarly, the internet technology is having highest impact on people. Our existence, has been turned upside down due to this certain technology which is Internet.  From office to home, education, government, healthcare even the ways in which we interact with each other. Revolution of Communication, where ordering a hot and spicy biryani or sharing messages, communicating with your loved ones, sending picture, etc. is all possible due to internet technology. Even for entertain purpose to relax or pass our lazy day we use internet technology to watch different videos, reading manga or any necessary book. Even I am addicted to the manga which I cannot access with out internet and won’t be able to easy different exciting stories. Even teaching tools, taking references for our coursework and to understand any topic in better ways this technology is playing necessary role. In business, internet technology acts as medium of advertising products or even giving idea for startup. Its just internet is a technology that provide necessary documents in the form of website and helps us to access different information and gain knowledge. For youth, main impact causing by internet technology is in gaming. Who do not know PUBG…...the most popular game and even popular for streaming? What if there is no Wi-Fi at home, what would happen if the technology such as 3Gs were not developed, it would have been difficult to play and fight with AK 47 in the pubg battlefield or even developing this game or any game would not have been come in the people’s mind. A day without phone or a day without electricity or a day without network, People would start getting bored, it will difficult to run any organization. I had been working at hotel during the break where the Wi-Fi connection was too weak. While working as front office trainee and gathering feedback from guests they would always be disappointed with the internet facilities that had been provided. There was a day when many people from a non-government organization had come to stay at our hotel but due to wi-fi problem one of the ladies could stay for more than one day because she missed her presentation. And it is great loss to lose customer from any organization. This is just an example where lack of internet technology can bring downfall for any company. Coming back to our daily lives and in this pandemic period where we have to lock ourselves in our house doing nothing it would have been devasting period if there were no internet. And talking about the study where every institution is having online class, many students are lacking behind due to lack of use of technologies in their house. If we are lost anywhere with the help of google map, we can know the direction.</br></br>Many people are addicted with the internet technology. There are many different technologies accept the Internet technologies. In this blog, I prefer to describe about internet technologies which relate all other technology and had been playing with our life in a sense that we feel our life lifeless if we cannot access internet. But this where modern technology is evolving and the series of networks, radiation, frequency are being tangled with our daily’s life. Impact of internet is not only positive. If one were to ask to live in an isolated island with beautiful bungalow along with other two necessity which are food and cloth but no any technology no any internet access then answer will of course no. Some people can say it’s to fun and refreshing to be far away from everything but up to when three days, one week or let’s say one month then what would you do if you were to live their whole life or let’s say even living one year will be hard, we work hard to afford this technology but this technology is giving us an unhealthy life style. As the invention of technology was to make our work easier but advancing the technology is making people lose faith in hardship. I believe that everything in this world have negative side but its us who should know the technology was invented to make our life easier not to control our life and make it hard for us to even spend a single moment without it.</br></br>Its not that technology is bad, it only a kind reminder to all of people to enjoy our life which is out side the screen, free your ties with network just give it time when needed but do not forget you have family apart from the guy you meet on tinder or Facebook. Just know that we are human who have made technology but they are just network structure to share our ideas or to live better life.</p>
